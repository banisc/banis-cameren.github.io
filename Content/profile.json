  "AboutText": "Aloha! I'm Cameren Banis, an Electrical Engineering student passionate about power systems, renewable system design, and control system modeling. Currently I am pursuing my undergraduate degree at Seattle Pacific University. I am dedicated to gaining experience with power system planning and design and learning how to integrate these skills in community oriented projects. I've worked with Hawaiian Electric Company on overhead and underground distribution projects revolving around grid hardening efforts and wildfire safety. Ouside of class, I am currently conducting research on Kite control units and working on the design and construction of a small microgrid to be installed on campus."
